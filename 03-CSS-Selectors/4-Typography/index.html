    <p>In the late summer of the year we lived in a house in a village
        that look accross the river & the plan to the mountains. in the bed of the river
        there war pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clean
        and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down 
        the road and the dust they raised powdered the leavs of the trees.
        The trunks of the tree too were dusty and leaves fell early that year and we saw the
        troops marching along the road of the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze,
        falling and the solders marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.

        The plan was rich with crops; there were many orchards of fruits trees and beyound the plain mountains
        were down and bare. There was fighting in the mountains and at night we could see the 
        fleashes from the artiellery. In the dark it was like summer lightning, but the nights were cool
        and there was not the feeling of a storm comming.
